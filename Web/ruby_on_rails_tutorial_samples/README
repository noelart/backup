This ZIP archive contains copies of the first three chapters of the Ruby on Rails Tutorial, 2nd Edition, as PDF, EPUB, and MOBI files.

For technical reasons, it's harder to produce partial books than the full book,* so these sample files are made by hand. As a result, the sample books are sometimes a little out of date. Rest assured that the contents of books purchased from railstutorial.org are generated automatically from the book's source and are always fully up to date. 

*For example, to make the sample PDF I have to produce the full book and then slice out a few chapters by hand using a PDF manipulator. Unfortunately, producing a partial book using only the source for the first few chapters doesn't work because in that case the cross-references aren't calculated correctly. Someday I hope to automate this process, but for now I have to do it by hand.
